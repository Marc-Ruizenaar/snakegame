# 🎮 Snake Game 🎮
This is my second game built with Vanilla JavaScript, following my first project the T-Rex Game. I started building JavaScript games to improve my JavaScript skills

# 🚀 What I Learned:
- Canvas tag: I started off with a `<section>` tag because I did not know what a `<canvas>` tag was. This tag made game development much more accessible and streamlined, providing better control over rendering game graphics. Sadly, it was too late to rebuild my game.
- File Organization: Initially, I had all my JavaScript in a single file, which quickly became messy and hard to manage. I've since improved by organizing the code and separating the logic to keep everything clean and maintainable.
- Snake Growth Logic: One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to grow the snake and add new body segments. After checking out other peoples Snake games code, I realized the solution was simpler than I first thought.

# 🛠️ Areas for Improvement:
- Add a leaderboard
- Improve UI
- Make it playable on Mobile
